# Footer

## Branding, quick links, and system status with light/dark theming.

The Footer provides site-wide branding and utility links. It supports both light and dark appearances via the `darkMode` prop, and is designed to maintain readability against a variety of backgrounds.

Usage tips:

- Choose `darkMode={true}` for dark backgrounds; `false` for light backgrounds.
- Keep link density reasonable to avoid clutter at the bottom of pages.
- Surface status/uptime and essential policies (privacy, terms) when applicable.

<ArgsTable story="^" />

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Light Mode">
    <div style={{ background: "#f8fafc", padding: "1rem" }}>
      <Footer darkMode={false} />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dark Mode">
    <div style={{ background: "#0b1020", padding: "1rem" }}>
      <Footer darkMode={true} />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Ensure all links have descriptive text.
- Check color contrast for text and icons in both themes.
- Keep focus indicators visible against the chosen background.
