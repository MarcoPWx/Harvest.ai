# Agent Showcase (Interview)

<Meta title="Labs/Agent Showcase" />

A presenter-friendly single page to explain how the Agent works in this repo, what’s canonical, and how to demo effectively.

## How I work {#how-i-work}

- I run fully inside your repo context; no external clipboard scripts required
- I update canonical docs (DevLog, Epics, System Status) directly from conversation context
- I follow the Agent Boot Contract: TDD-first, safe defaults, and secure handling of env secrets

## Canonical docs & consistency {#canon}

- DevLog: /docs/status/DEVLOG.md
- Epics: /docs/roadmap/EPICS.md
- System Status: /docs/SYSTEM_STATUS.md
- Agent Boot: /docs/status/AGENT_BOOT.md
- Storybook mirrors these and validates them via small status components (e.g., DocsStatus)

## Demo agenda {#demo-agenda}

1) Labs/Index — set context
2) Docs/Agent Boot — rules and guardrails
3) Technology Overview Lab — stack & references
4) S2S Streaming & Threads (live) — JSON and SSE
5) AI Service Lab — fallback, cache, errors, quality, embeddings
6) User Journeys — deterministic flows
7) Provider Adapters Lab — PROVIDERS_ON walk‑through (no secrets in UI)
8) Security Lab — headers, CSP, COOP/COEP
9) Observability & Status Dashboard — ops view

## Talk track (short) {#talk-track}

- Mock-first, then flips to real providers when keys exist — same code paths, deterministic testing
- Single source of truth for docs; I keep them fresh as part of work, not as a separate step
- S2S routes use structured events; UI surfaces progress robustly and handles rate limits
- Security posture is explicit in next.config.mjs; CSP stays narrow; connect-src widened only if needed
- Observability is pragmatic: structured logs and minimal metrics for local feedback
