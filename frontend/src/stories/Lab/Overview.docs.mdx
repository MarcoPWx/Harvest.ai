# Learning Lab

<Meta title="Lab/Overview" />

The Learning Lab is a curated, learning‑centric space inside Storybook. It’s where we collect:

- Headlines: opinionated, product-ready messaging and value framing
- Definitions: clear vocabulary for the team and docs
- Curated Journeys: step‑by‑step walkthroughs of core experiences (mock-first and real provider)

## Why this lab?

- Keep product language, mental models, and journeys close to the codebase
- Make it easy for new contributors to ramp up with consistent definitions
- Provide living, runnable journeys that reference our mocks and E2E flags

## Sections

- Lab/Headlines — product/value headlines and narratives
- Lab/Definitions — shared vocabulary (BYOK, SSE, MSW, provider adapter, etc.)
- Lab/Curated Journeys — guided flows with links to interactive pages and docs

## Start here

- Read Lab/Headlines to align on the story we tell
- Skim Lab/Definitions to internalize the vocabulary
- Run through Lab/Curated Journeys to experience the system end-to-end

## Contribute

- Keep entries concise; link out to deeper technical docs when needed
- Prefer examples and runnable links (e.g., Docs/API Playground, Docs/User Journeys)
- Submit changes alongside feature PRs to keep the lab fresh
