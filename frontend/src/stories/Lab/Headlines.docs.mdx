# Headlines

<Meta title="Lab/Headlines" />

Opinionated, product-ready headlines and messages we can reuse across the site, Storybook, and demos.

## Core value

- Turn raw notes into polished outputs in seconds — with your own model key
- BYOK done right: full privacy, full control, real costs up front
- Streaming output with progress you can feel — no blank screens
- Mock-first DX: ship the UX today, plug in your provider tomorrow

## Trust & control

- Your key, your provider, your data — we don’t store content or keys
- Cost transparency per run: tokens, model, estimates, cache hits
- Quality scoring to make output quality visible, not mysterious

## Developer experience

- One provider adapter interface — swap in your model with minimal code
- JSON/SSE routes with MSW mocks for local and Storybook exercises
- Real-time playgrounds and journeys to converge design + backend

## Team narrative (short)

- Imagine: your team has the UI, the mocks, and real model calls — all in one place
- You can demo end-to-end today (mocked), then flip to staging provider tomorrow
- That’s how we ship usable experiences early and safely scale to “real” AI
