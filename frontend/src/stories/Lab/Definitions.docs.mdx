## AI Provider {#ai-provider}

A third-party or proprietary model backend (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, internal inference service).

## BYOK {#byok}

Bring Your Own Key. Users provide their own API key which is only used client→server for generation and not stored.

## SSE {#sse}

Server-Sent Events. A streaming HTTP response used to progressively deliver content/tokens.

## MSW {#msw}

Mock Service Worker. Intercepts network requests in dev/Storybook to return deterministic mocks.

## Mock-first {#mock-first}

A development strategy: build the UX and flows against stable mocks first; swap real models later.

## Provider adapter {#provider-adapter}

An implementation of a small interface (generate, streaming, abort, retries, cost/usage) per provider.

## Cost telemetry {#cost-telemetry}

Tokens used, model, estimated cost per call — surfaced in UI and logs.

## Quality scoring {#quality-scoring}

A heuristic score reported alongside results to make perceived output quality explicit.

## E2E mode {#e2e-mode}

A deterministic testing mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E=1) used with MSW to stabilize Playwright tests.
