Welcome to the project docs. Start with the Learning Lab for a curated, learning‑centric view.

## Start here

- Learning Lab → Overview
- Learning Lab → User Journeys — Extended (20)
- Learning Lab → S2S Journeys — Extended (50)

## Quick links

- Docs/API Playground — try JSON generate
- Docs/User Journeys — run mocked end‑to‑end flows
- Specs/S2S — Gateway Reference — server‑to‑server routes

## Notes

- Mock‑first strategy: build the UX and tests against MSW, then switch on real providers safely.
- E2E mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E=1) ensures deterministic behavior for Playwright.
