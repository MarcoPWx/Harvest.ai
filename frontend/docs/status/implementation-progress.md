- [x] Fix unit tests for Navigation, Layout, EcosystemWidget
- [x] Fix AIService unit tests (fallback, cache, error tracking)
- [ ] Align Playwright E2E tests with current UI and routes

### Phase 2: Supabase Backend Foundations

Progress: 🟡 In Progress

- [x] Auth routes and session management
- [x] Content generation records and history
- [ ] Usage logging and limits

### Phase 3: Reliability & CI/CD

Progress: 📝 Planned

- [ ] Coverage thresholds and reports
- [ ] Sentry + basic metrics surfaced in status page
- [ ] CI gates (type, lint, unit, e2e, build)

## 📝 Activity Log

### 2025-08-28

- Added dev:mock script and runtime MSW start
- Resolved multiple unit test failures; remaining failures isolated to AIService tests
- Prepared Epics & Tasks roadmap and updated master doc
- Added SSE demo API route at /api/sse-demo (CORS-enabled)
- Storybook: added Live WS→SSE fallback demo, SSE Client, and Latency & Error Profiles
- Dev tools: added SSE Viewer and WebSocket Client; created Network Playground (/dev/network)
- MSW: added header (x-mock-delay, x-mock-error-rate) and cookie (harvest_mock_delay, harvest_mock_error_rate) controls
- Consolidated testing docs into docs/testing/TESTING.md and updated /docs/testing MDX; marked legacy docs deprecated

### 2025-08-28 (later)

- Storybook: Project Docs Reader now reads directly from repo /docs (served statically) with a left navigation and lightweight Markdown rendering (headings, code, links, lists)
- Storybook: Global Help panel button via per-story parameter (repoDocPath) across docs and component stories
- Storybook: Swagger UI embedded as Docs/Swagger UI (requires dev server); /api/openapi.json CORS-enabled for cross-origin from Storybook
- MDX 3 readiness: aligned Next app (@next/mdx) and Storybook to MDX v3 runtime; story files require no changes
- MSW: header-based delay/error injection applied consistently to all handlers (auth, user, templates, generation, debug, localMemory)
- Dev Network Playground: presets + batch runner added; CSV export; cookie defaults and per-request overrides
- Docs: Interview Brief, Tech Stack Cheat Sheet, and Local Dev Guide clarified with at-a-glance summaries and quick starts

Next Action: Fix AIService tests and adjust mocks for fallback/error flows

---

## 📚 New/Updated Guides

- Added Local Development Guide: [docs/status/LOCAL_DEV_GUIDE.md](./LOCAL_DEV_GUIDE.md)
  - Covers dev:mock mode (MSW + WebSocket mocks), Storybook API playgrounds, Swagger UI, unit/E2E workflows, and troubleshooting
- Added Operations Book: [../runbooks/OPERATIONS_BOOK.md](../runbooks/OPERATIONS_BOOK.md)
  - Local & production ops, CI, security, runbooks, and real-time hardening
- Added Production Checklist: [../runbooks/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md](../runbooks/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md)
  - Preflight checks for secrets, tests, docs, observability, security, smoke tests, rollback

## 🎯 Next Immediate Tasks

1. Unit Tests

- [ ] Update AIService tests to reflect current fallback chain and error messages
- [ ] Ensure Supabase calls are mocked for cache/usage tracking

2. E2E Tests

- [ ] Update titles/selectors to match current pages
- [ ] Add robust waits and state assertions; reduce flakiness

3. Mocks

- [ ] Add WebSocket mock events for generation progress
- [ ] Reuse MSW in Playwright setup for offline runs

## 📊 Metrics (local)

|| Metric | Current | Target |
||--------|---------|--------|
|| Unit Test Suites | 5/5 passing | 5/5 |
|| Unit Tests | 58/58 passing | 58/58 |
|| E2E Stability | Flaky | Stable |
|| Storybook | Working | All key components covered |

## 🚧 Known Blockers

1. MSW in Jest (ESM) adds complexity
   - Mitigation: Avoid MSW in Jest; mock fetch/services directly
2. AI provider mocks diverge from implementation
   - Mitigation: Update tests to assert behavior, not specific messages

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- MSW worker wired and dev:mock script added
- Navigation/Layout/EcosystemWidget tests stabilized
- Master documentation updated with epics and accurate commands
