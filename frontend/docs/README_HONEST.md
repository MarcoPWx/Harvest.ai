# Harvest.ai Documentation - REALITY CHECK

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This is the HONEST state of the project. Most features listed in other docs DON'T EXIST.

## 🔴 Project Reality

**What this is**: A frontend-only prototype with nice UI and zero backend functionality  
**Completion Level**: ~20% of a real application  
**Backend Status**: NONE EXISTS  
**Database Status**: NONE EXISTS  
**API Status**: ALL MOCKED/FAKE  
**Test Status**: MOSTLY BROKEN (Unit: 82.8% pass, E2E: 0% pass)

| "Responsive design"                 | Partially works                        | ⚠️       |

## 🗂️ What Actually Exists

### ✅ Working (UI Only)

- **Pages that load**: Home, Demo, System, Roadmap, Status, Format, Docs
- **Dark mode toggle**: Saves preference to localStorage
- **Navigation**: Links between pages work (desktop only)
- **Pretty animations**: Framer Motion effects (cause test warnings)
- **Tailwind styling**: CSS framework configured

### ⚠️ Broken/Partial

- **Mobile navigation**: Menu button has no accessibility labels
- **Unit tests**: 6 out of 35 tests failing
- **E2E tests**: 100% failure rate (0/115 passing)
- **API routes**: Exist but return hardcoded fake data
- **Forms**: Accept input but don't process anything

### ❌ Doesn't Exist At All

- Backend server
- Database (PostgreSQL, Redis, or any)
- Authentication system
- User accounts/sessions
- Real API integrations
- Payment processing
- File uploads/storage
- Email service
- WebSockets
- Caching layer
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring/analytics
- Error tracking
- CI/CD pipeline
- Production deployment

## 🧪 Testing Reality

```bash
# What happens when you run tests:
npm test          # 6 tests fail (Navigation, Layout, EcosystemWidget)
npm run test:e2e  # ALL tests fail (wrong project - expects NatureQuest)
```

### Known Test Failures:

1. **Navigation**: Mobile menu missing aria-labels
2. **Layout**: Multiple elements with same text
3. **Layout**: localStorage not properly mocked
4. **EcosystemWidget**: Framer Motion props leak to DOM
5. **EcosystemWidget**: Click callbacks don't trigger
6. **E2E**: Tests written for different app entirely

## 📁 Real File Structure

```
frontend/
├── src/app/              # Next.js pages (UI only)
│   ├── page.tsx         # Home page (static)
│   ├── demo/            # Demo page (shows widget)
│   ├── format/          # Format page (form does nothing)

```

## 🚀 How to Run What Works

```bash
# This works - starts dev server
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000

# This works - shows component library
npm run storybook

# This "works" - expect 6 failures
npm test

# This fails completely - wrong project
npm run test:e2e
```

## 🛠️ To Make This Real

### Minimum to be functional (1-2 weeks)

1. Connect to OpenAI API for real text generation
2. Add basic backend with Next.js API routes
3. Fix the 6 failing unit tests
4. Add error handling

### To be a real product (2-3 months)

1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Implement authentication (NextAuth.js)
3. Add payment system (Stripe)
4. Create user dashboard
5. Implement rate limiting
6. Add monitoring
7. Deploy to production
8. Rewrite E2E tests for correct app

## 📊 Honest Metrics

| Metric                 | Current State        | Production Ready    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Code completeness      | ~20%                 | Need 80% more       |
| Test coverage          | Unknown              | Need proper testing |
| Test pass rate         | Unit: 82.8%, E2E: 0% | Need 95%+           |
| Backend implementation | 0%                   | Need full backend   |
| Database               | None                 | Need PostgreSQL     |
| Authentication         | None                 | Need auth system    |
| Production readiness   | 0%                   | 2-3 months away     |

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

1. **This is NOT production ready** - It's a UI prototype
2. **There is NO backend** - Everything is mocked
3. **Tests are broken** - Don't trust test results
4. **No data persists** - Refreshing loses everything
5. **API docs are fiction** - Describe APIs that don't exist
6. **Performance unmeasured** - No optimization done
7. **Security non-existent** - No auth, no protection

## 📝 Documentation Truth Table

| Document               | Trustworthiness | Notes                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| SYSTEM_STATUS.md       | ✅ Accurate     | Shows real state                |
| TEST_STATUS.md         | ✅ Accurate     | Shows test failures             |
| DEVELOPMENT.md         | ✅ Accurate     | Pragmatic runbook               |
| REST_API.md            | ❌ Fictional    | APIs don't exist                |
| SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md | ❌ Aspirational | Describes future state          |
| Original README.md     | ❌ Misleading   | Lists features that don't exist |

## 🎯 What to Actually Work On

If you want to contribute, here's what REALLY needs doing:

1. **Fix the broken tests** (6 unit test failures)
2. **Add a real backend** (implement at least one real API endpoint)
3. **Connect to OpenAI** (make content generation actually work)
4. **Add a database** (PostgreSQL with Prisma)
5. **Implement auth** (NextAuth.js basic setup)
6. **Deploy somewhere** (Vercel free tier)

## 💡 The Truth

This is a **nice-looking frontend prototype** that could become a real product with 2-3 months of additional development. It's not close to production-ready, has no backend, no database, and mostly broken tests.

**If you're looking for a working AI content transformation tool, this isn't it yet.**
