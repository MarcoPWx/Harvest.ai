## 🔧 What We Fixed Today

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **MDX Route Issues** → Replaced with TSX wrappers
2. **Forbidden Exports** → Moved shared state out of route files
3. **Supabase Type Errors** → Applied temporary `any` casts
4. **Timer Type Conflicts** → Used `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`
5. **Next Link Issues** → Replaced all `<a>` with `<Link>`
6. **MSW Field Names** → Fixed all schema inconsistencies
7. **Storybook Args** → Added required props to all stories

### Build Pipeline:
```bash
✅ npm install
✅ npm run build  
✅ npm test
🔄 npm run test:e2e (runs but needs review)
✅ npm run storybook:build
```

## 🎯 Priority Actions (Next 48 Hours)

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (Issue #8)
```bash
# Ready to deploy NOW
vercel --prod
```
- Enable MSW for demo mode
- Configure environment variables
- Set up preview deployments

### 2. Implement UJ-01 ContentGenerator (Issue #6)
- [ ] Create ContentGenerator test file
- [ ] Write 18 comprehensive tests
- [ ] Implement real API endpoint
- [ ] Add SSE streaming support
- [ ] Remove mock data dependency

### 3. Fix Storybook Deploy
- [ ] Install eslint-plugin-storybook
- [ ] Deploy to Chromatic
- [ ] Enable visual regression testing

## 📈 Next Week Targets

### Week of Sept 2-8, 2025

| Day | Focus | Deliverable |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Mon | Deploy | Vercel + Chromatic live |
| Tue | UJ-01 Tests | ContentGenerator tests passing |
| Wed | UJ-01 API | Real endpoint working |
| Thu | SSE Stream | Streaming implementation |
| Fri | UJ-02 | Rate limiting feature |
| Weekend | Review | Documentation + cleanup |

### Success Metrics:
- [ ] 1 feature fully working (UJ-01)
- [ ] Live deployment on Vercel
- [ ] ContentGenerator with real data
- [ ] 50+ passing feature tests
- [ ] Storybook deployed

---

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

### 🟢 LOW RISK
- Build pipeline (stable)
- Deployment readiness
- Test infrastructure

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK  
- ContentGenerator implementation complexity
- SSE streaming patterns
- API integration timing

### 🔴 HIGH RISK
- No backend exists yet
- All features using mock data
- <1% actual implementation

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **DEPLOY FIRST** - Get something live today
2. **ONE FEATURE** - Focus only on UJ-01 until complete
3. **REAL DATA** - Replace mocks incrementally

### Stop Doing:
- ❌ Creating more issues
- ❌ Planning without execution
- ❌ Spreading effort across multiple features

### Start Doing:
- ✅ Daily deployments
- ✅ Feature-complete deliveries
- ✅ User-visible progress

## 📝 Notes

- Build is stable and deployment-ready
- Testing infrastructure is solid
- Focus must shift from fixing to building
- One complete feature > many partial features
