# 📊 Harvest.ai Accountability Tracker

## Promise vs Reality - 2025-08-31

### What Was Promised

- **70 Features Total**:
  - 20 User Journeys (UJ-01 to UJ-20)
  - 50 Server-to-Server Flows (S2S-01 to S2S-50)
- **Timeline**: 6 days to complete
- **Delivery**: Working, tested, deployed features

### What Was Actually Delivered

#### ✅ Created (but not implemented):

- **GitHub Issues**: 30+ issues created for tracking
- **Test Files**:
  - ContentGenerator tests (18 test cases) - NOT PASSING
  - UJ-01 tests (5 test cases) - Passing but component is partial
- **Components**:
  - ContentGenerator.tsx - EXISTS but uses mock data
  - UJ01-DemoHappyPath.tsx - EXISTS but incomplete
- **Scripts**:
  - Issue creation scripts - WORKING

#### 🔴 Not Delivered:

- **Working Features**: 0 of 70 actually working
- **API Integration**: ContentGenerator still uses hardcoded mocks
- **Streaming**: No SSE implementation
- **Deployment**: Not on Vercel
- **Real Backend**: No actual API endpoints
- **Tour System**: Exists but broken
- **MSW Integration**: Handlers exist but not used

### Completion Percentage

```
User Journeys:     1/20  (5%)  - Only UJ-01 partially done
S2S Flows:         0/50  (0%)  - None implemented
Tests Written:    23/70  (33%) - But most not passing
Tests Passing:     5/70  (7%)  - Only UJ-01 tests pass
Deployed:          0/70  (0%)  - Nothing deployed
ACTUAL COMPLETE:   0/70  (0%)  - Nothing fully working
```

### GitHub Issues Created

| Category      | Promised | Issues Created | Actually Done    |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Core Epics    | 3        | 3              | 0                |
| User Journeys | 20       | 20             | 0.05 (1 partial) |
| S2S Flows     | 50       | 10+            | 0                |
| Deployment    | 3        | 3              | 0                |
| **TOTAL**     | **76**   | **36+**        | **0.05**         |

### Time Spent vs Results

- **Time**: Full day of work
- **Output**:
  - Files created: Yes
  - Tests written: Some
  - Features working: No
  - Deployed: No

### The Hard Truth

**We're at < 1% completion** of what was promised. We have:

- Scripts that create issues ✅
- Tests that don't pass ❌
- Components that use fake data ❌
- No deployment ❌
- No real functionality ❌

### What Needs to Happen

1. **Stop creating more promises**
2. **Fix what exists**:
   - Make ContentGenerator tests pass
   - Implement real API calls
   - Deploy something (even if mocked)
3. **Focus on 1 feature at a time**:
   - Complete UJ-01 fully
   - Then UJ-02
   - Build momentum with working code

### Lessons Learned

1. **Creating files ≠ Creating features**
2. **Writing tests ≠ Features working**
3. **Making promises ≠ Delivering value**
4. **GitHub issues ≠ Completed work**

### Next Action Items

Instead of 70 features, focus on:

1. [ ] Make ContentGenerator work with real API
2. [ ] Deploy to Vercel (even if just mocked)
3. [ ] Complete ONE user journey end-to-end
4. [ ] Stop adding new scope until something works
