- Interactive labs for learning
- Live coding playgrounds
- **Why it matters**: This IS the education value

#### 3. Tour System Throughout ‚≠ê

**Critical for**: Guided learning experience

- In-app tours for users
- Storybook tours for developers
- Step-by-step journey walkthroughs
- **Why it matters**: This makes it accessible to everyone

#### 4. Labs Section ‚≠ê

**Critical for**: Experimentation and learning

- MSW mocking patterns
- SSE implementation demos
- WebSocket playgrounds
- Performance testing tools
- Accessibility checkers
- **Why it matters**: This is where developers learn by doing

10. **Accessibility Lab** - A11y testing tools

### Layer 3: User Journey Demonstrations (20)

Each journey teaches a specific pattern:

- UJ-01: Basic CRUD with streaming
- UJ-02: Rate limiting and retry logic
- UJ-03: Error boundaries and recovery
- UJ-04: Caching strategies
- ... (each journey is a lesson)

### Layer 4: S2S Reference Patterns (50)

Not redundant - each shows a different pattern:

- Authentication flows
- Streaming implementations
- Error handling strategies
- Caching patterns
- Thread management
- ... (each S2S is a backend lesson)
