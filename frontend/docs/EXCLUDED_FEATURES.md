# 🚫 Excluded Features - What We're NOT Building

## Executive Summary
We excluded **126 redundant issues** that were duplicates, overlaps, or artificial inflation of the actual work.

---

## 1. Excluded S2S Issues (45 issues removed)

## 2. Excluded Storybook Story Issues (70 issues removed)

### UJ Storybook Stories (20 issues) ❌
**Excluded because**: Each User Journey should include its own Storybook story
- ❌ [Story] UJ-01 through UJ-20 Storybook Implementation
**Included in**: Each UJ issue already has "Create Storybook story" as acceptance criteria

### S2S Storybook Stories (50 issues) ❌
**Excluded because**: Backend APIs don't need individual UI stories
- ❌ [Story] S2S-01 through S2S-50 Demo
**Reality**: Only ~5 S2S flows need UI demos (streaming, caching visualization)

---

## 3. Excluded Test Issues (20 issues removed)

### Individual E2E Test Issues ❌
**Excluded because**: E2E tests are part of each User Journey
- ❌ [Test] E2E for UJ-01 through UJ-20
**Included in**: Each UJ issue has E2E tests as acceptance criteria

---

## 4. Excluded Feature Duplicates

### ContentGenerator API Integration ❌
**Excluded because**: This IS User Journey 01
- ❌ Separate ContentGenerator feature issue
**Included in**: UJ-01 Demo Happy Path (#6)

### MSW Production Mode ❌
**Excluded because**: Part of deployment
- ❌ Separate MSW production issue
**Included in**: Vercel Deployment issue (#8)

### Individual Format Features ❌
**Excluded because**: Formats are parameters, not features
- ❌ Separate blog generation feature
- ❌ Separate email generation feature
- ❌ Separate summary generation feature
**Included in**: Single Generation API (#34)

---

## 5. Artificial Feature Splits We Avoided

### What We're NOT Doing:
1. ❌ Creating separate issues for frontend and backend of the same feature
2. ❌ Creating separate issues for tests and implementation
3. ❌ Creating separate issues for each HTTP status code
4. ❌ Creating separate issues for each format type
5. ❌ Creating separate issues for Storybook stories
6. ❌ Creating separate issues for documentation

### Each Issue Now Includes:
✅ Frontend implementation
✅ Backend implementation  
✅ Unit tests
✅ E2E tests
✅ Storybook story
✅ Documentation

## The Features We're Actually Building

### Core Systems (10)
1. ✅ Content Generation System (all formats)
2. ✅ Error Handling System (all error types)
3. ✅ Caching System
4. ✅ Thread/Session Management
5. ✅ SSE Streaming
6. ✅ Operations/Admin API
7. ✅ Tour System
8. ✅ Authentication/BYOK
9. ✅ Deployment Pipeline
10. ✅ Testing Infrastructure

### User Experiences (20)
All 20 User Journeys remain, but each includes its own:
- Backend API work
- Frontend implementation
- Tests (unit and E2E)
- Storybook story
- Documentation

## Why This Matters

### Before (Inflated Scope):
- 166 issues tracking the same work multiple times
- Confusing ownership
- Artificial complexity
- Impossible to deliver

### After (Realistic Scope):
- 42 issues tracking unique work
- Clear ownership
- Actual features
- Deliverable in reasonable time

### The Truth:
We were tracking **how we build** (tests, stories, backend, frontend) instead of **what we build** (features). Now we track features, and each feature includes everything needed to complete it.
