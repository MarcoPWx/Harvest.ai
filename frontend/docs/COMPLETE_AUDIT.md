## 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING ISSUES

### Must Create Immediately:
1. **45 S2S Flow Issues** (S2S-06 to S2S-50)
2. **2 Deployment Issues** (Chromatic, CI/CD)
3. **70+ Storybook Story Issues** (one per journey/flow)
4. **Feature Integration Issues**:
   - ContentGenerator Real API Integration
   - Tour System Fix
   - MSW Production Mode
   - Testing Infrastructure

### The Reality:
- We have tracking for only **19% of promised work**
- **135+ issues still need to be created**
- Even the created issues have **0% implementation**

---

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW

### Option 1: Create All Missing Issues (Recommended)
Run the complete script to create all 135+ missing issues

### Option 2: Reduce Scope Drastically
Admit we can't deliver 166 features and focus on:
- 5 core user journeys
- 5 S2S flows  
- 1 deployment target
- Total: 11 features instead of 166

### Option 3: Be Honest About Timeline
At current pace (0 features/day), we need:
- Realistic timeline: 3-6 months
- Not 6 days
