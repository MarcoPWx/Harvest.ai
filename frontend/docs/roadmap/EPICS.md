### In-Progress Summary

- Epic A: Stabilize Unit Tests â€” [~] Fix AIService tests to align with fallback/error handling

## Epic A: Stabilize Unit Tests

- Goal: All unit tests pass reliably on CI with clear, fast feedback.
- Owner: Frontend
- Priority: P0

Tasks:

1. [~] Fix AIService tests to align with current fallback and error handling
   - Criteria: service.test.ts passes; mocks reflect current OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini flows
   - Notes: Supabase client calls should be mocked for cache/usage updates
   - Links: src/lib/ai/service.ts, src/lib/ai/**tests**/service.test.ts
2. [x] Navigation tests stable for desktop/mobile interactions
   - Criteria: No role/name query failures; mobile menu a11y verified
   - Links: src/components/layout/**tests**/Navigation.test.tsx
3. [x] Layout and EcosystemWidget tests use robust selectors and suppress animation warnings
   - Criteria: Tests pass without React unknown prop warnings
   - Links: src/components/**tests**/Layout.test.tsx, src/components/ecosystem/**tests**/EcosystemWidget.test.tsx
4. [ ] Add coverage thresholds and collect coverage in CI
   - Criteria: Failing build if coverage < thresholds; text/HTML report artifact

---

## Epic B: E2E Test Reliability (Playwright)

- Goal: Critical user flows validated across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit.
- Owner: Frontend/QA
- Priority: P0

Tasks:

1. [ ] Align titles/labels and routes with current UI (e.g., project name, page headings)
   - Criteria: Home, Demo, Format, Docs pass basic smoke tests
2. [ ] Fix navigation flows, timeouts, and flakiness with proper waits
   - Criteria: Zero flaky retries locally; retry-based CI strategy in place
3. [ ] Add visual snapshot baselines and per-project thresholds
   - Criteria: Snapshots stored and reviewed; CI job compares on PRs

---

## Epic C: Mock-First Backend with MSW

- Goal: Frontend fully functional without real backend; deterministic demos.
- Owner: Frontend
- Priority: P0

Tasks:

1. [x] Seed mock DB and create handlers for auth, generation, templates, users
   - Links: src/mocks/db/schema.ts, src/mocks/handlers/
2. [x] Start worker in dev via client wrapper; opt-in via NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MSW
   - Links: src/components/ClientLayoutWrapper.tsx
3. [ ] Add WebSocket mock server and events for generation progress/notifications
   - Criteria: UI reflects streaming/progress in demo mode
4. [ ] Integrate MSW into Playwright tests via setup/teardown
   - Criteria: E2E tests run fully offline

---

## Epic D: Supabase Backend Foundations

- Goal: Minimal real backend for auth, content, and usage tracking.
- Owner: Backend
- Priority: P1

Tasks:

1. [ ] Implement server/client Supabase clients and env validation
   - Links: src/lib/supabase/
2. [ ] Create API routes for generate, history, templates backed by Supabase
   - Links: src/app/api/
3. [ ] Auth: email/password + OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Criteria: Protected routes for dashboard/settings
4. [ ] Migrations and types in repo; apply on CI
   - Links: supabase/, scripts

---

## Epic E: AI Service Robustness

- Goal: Provider-agnostic service with fallback, usage tracking, and caching.
- Owner: AI
- Priority: P1

Tasks:

1. [ ] Provider adapters (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini) with uniform interfaces
2. [ ] Fallback chain and error classification (rate limit, key errors)
3. [ ] Cost and token tracking; pricing table versioning
4. [ ] Cache strategy (request hash + TTL) with Supabase or Redis (later)

---

## Epic F: Authentication & User Management

- Goal: Full auth flow, profile, preferences, and session management.
- Owner: Backend/Frontend
- Priority: P1

Tasks:

1. [ ] Login/Signup pages in app router
2. [ ] Session management, SSR hydration, and client hooks
3. [ ] Profile and preferences endpoints and UI

---

## Epic G: Billing & Subscriptions

- Goal: Stripe integration for Free/Pro/Team plans.
- Owner: Backend
- Priority: P2

Tasks:

1. [ ] Stripe products/prices config and webhook handling
2. [ ] Customer portal and payment methods UI
3. [ ] Usage-based limits enforced at API

---

## Epic H: Observability & Operations

- Goal: Error tracking, logs, metrics, and CI/CD quality gates.
- Owner: DevOps
- Priority: P2

Tasks:

1. [ ] Sentry integration and source maps
2. [ ] Basic metrics (latency, error rate) surfaced in status page
3. [ ] CI gates: type-check, lint, unit, e2e, coverage, build

---

## Epic I: Accessibility & Performance

- Goal: WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard nav, and fast core vitals.
- Owner: Frontend
- Priority: P2

Tasks:

1. [ ] Axe checks in unit/E2E where feasible
2. [ ] Keyboard nav coverage in tests for nav/dialogs
3. [ ] Lighthouse performance budgets in CI (advisory)

---

## Epic J: Documentation & Storybook Coverage

- Goal: Source-of-truth docs and rich Storybook stories for all components.
- Owner: Docs/Frontend
- Priority: P2

Tasks:

1. [x] Expand Storybook to cover all key components (controls + a11y)
   - Added help panel parameter to stories (repoDocPath) so each story links to relevant docs
   - Added Swagger UI story; Project Docs Reader with left nav and Markdown rendering
2. [ ] Keep DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md in sync with scripts and routes
3. [x] API docs snapshot from runtime contracts and handlers
   - /api/openapi.json exposed and CORS-enabled; embedded in Storybook Swagger story
