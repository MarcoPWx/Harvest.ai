## üéØ Beta Requirements

### Beta Readiness Analysis (2025-08-30)

Readiness drivers:

- Engineering stability: ‚úÖ Local unit/integration tests fully green
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Extensive docs and Storybook; will add Beta-specific onboarding
- Critical features: ‚ùå Auth, ‚ùå DB persistence, ‚ùå Real AI, ‚ùå Billing still pending (see below)
- Security/Monitoring: ‚ö†Ô∏è Production posture not yet in place (CSP, Sentry, uptime)

Decision: Not Beta-ready until EPIC-002 (Auth), EPIC-003 (Real AI), EPIC-004 (DB) are completed. Testing foundation is strong enough to proceed aggressively once features land.

Go/No-Go gates:

- Go when all must-have items in "Definition of Beta Ready" are satisfied and smoke/E2E passes with real backends enabled
- No-Go if any of: auth data leakage, model API errors >1%, failing payments path, or unrecoverable provider errors without fallback

### Minimum Viable Beta (MVB)

To reach beta, we need:

1. **Working product** with real AI generation
2. **User accounts** with authentication
3. **Data persistence** for user content
4. **Basic monetization** (usage limits or payments)
5. **Production deployment** with monitoring
