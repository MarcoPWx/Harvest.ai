# Product Core & North Star

This page captures the product’s North Star, core definition, consolidated technology list, and the connected user journeys.

## North Star

- Be the most trusted way to turn raw input into a publishable draft in under 90 seconds, with full cost transparency and zero lock‑in.

### metric

- Time to First Useful Output (TTFUO) P90 ≤ 90 seconds

### Trust guardrails (supporting KPIs)

- Transparency Trust Score: price-verification rate ≤ 5%
- Export Success Rate: 100% (no lock-in)
- Crisis Return Rate: ≥ 90% of users come back during their next urgent need
- Quality Acceptance Rate: ≥ 80% outputs accepted without major rework

### Why this fits

- It directly ties to the core promise across docs: crisis-first value, radical transparency, and trust. Panic/Flow/Power journeys all serve the 90-second-to-useful-draft goal, while BYOK + export guarantee the trust posture.

## Core of the product

- What it is: An AI content transformation platform that turns any source (notes, docs, URLs, files) into professional outputs (blog posts, summaries, emails, quizzes, presentations), with a trust-first posture.
- Trust-first principles:
  - BYOK privacy: users bring their own AI provider keys; no vendor lock-in; export everything.
  - Radical transparency: clear, per-request cost breakdown and quality scoring.
  - Honest UX: realistic expectations, explicit errors, and easy exit (full export).
- Delivery surfaces:
  - Web app: simple “demo” and production UX with real-time streaming, quality/cost metrics, caching, and rate-limiting.
  - Developer platform: REST/SSE endpoints (and future SDK/webhooks) for integration and batch.
- Multi-provider engine:
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI supported with fallback and provider selection.
  - Streaming via SSE for real-time token/partial output; caching for repeat requests.
- Modes that meet users where they are:
  - Panic Mode: one-click “help me now” emergency flow.
  - Flow Mode: guided, low-friction creative workflow.
  - Power Mode: advanced controls, batching, templates, and team workflows.
- Enterprise track:
  - Security/compliance (BYOK, SOC2 posture, auditability), trust packages, pilot playbooks, and SLAs.
- Product ambition:
  - Be there exactly when needed (crisis timing), deliver exactly what’s promised (transparency), and scale from single-output wins to enterprise bulk.

## User journeys and how they connect

- Acquisition to Activation (trust-first and crisis-aware)
  - Landing → Rapid trust checks (cost transparency, honest quality scores) → Quick “Try the Demo”
  - Crisis-aware entry: if urgent patterns detected, show Panic Mode (“Save my night”; minimal inputs; cost visible)
- Onboarding (when accounts are enabled)
  - Signup → Email verification → Onboarding survey (use case, formats, volume) → BYOK configuration and validation
  - Trust ladder: progressively reveal power, surface costs/quality honestly, offer no-risk retries
- First value delivery: content generation flow
  - Select format → Provide source (text/URL/file) → Configure options/model → Generate
  - Realtime streaming (SSE): meta/tokens/partials → Quality + cost + latency metrics → Edit → Export (copy/download)
  - Caching enables instant subsequent runs; rate limits enforced with clear retry guidance
- Growth and return usage
  - Flow Mode: guided drafting and refining; saves time and educates user on best practices
  - Power Mode: batch generation, templates, histories, and (later) team collaboration
  - Nudges and timing: proactive suggestions aligned with calendars and prior behavior
- Monetization and plans (when enabled)
  - Free tier caps → Upgrade prompt → Plan selection → Payment → Unlock Pro/Team features
- Developer integration journey
  - Read API docs (Swagger UI) → Create API key(s) → Quick-start client → POST /api/generate or /generate/stream (SSE)
  - Webhooks/async jobs for batch and long-running flows; monitoring for rate/latency/usage
- Enterprise adoption journey
  - Security/compliance review (BYOK, auditability, DPA, posture docs) → Pilot program with success metrics → Rollout plan and SLAs
- Error and recovery flows (trust-preserving)
  - Input validation (clear messages), rate limit and quota handling (timers/backoff), provider failover, retries
  - Export and leave paths are explicit and easy; support touchpoints are direct and human
- Lifecycle connection (single narrative)
  - Attract (trust-first, timely value) → Onboard (BYOK, survey) → Activate (first generation success)
  - Retain (Flow/Power modes, templates, caching) → Monetize (plans) → Expand (teams, batch, API)
  - Enterprise: parallel “trust package → pilot → rollout” track that shares the same generation core
