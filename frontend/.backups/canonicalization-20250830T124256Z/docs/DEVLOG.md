# DEVLOG (Index)

This index exists so the DEVLOG appears in the Storybook Project Docs Reader (which scans the `/docs` folder).

- Canonical activity log (source of truth): [/docs/status/implementation-progress.md](/docs/status/implementation-progress.md)
- Concise top-level summary: `DEVLOG.md` at the repository root (outside `/docs`)

Notes

- The Storybook reader serves files under `/docs`. The root `DEVLOG.md` is referenced above for convenience but is not duplicated here.
- For the complete, detailed progress history, prefer the canonical file linked above.
