# Epics — Create & Update (Flow)

<Meta title="Flows/Epics — Create & Update" />

This flow sketches the core actions for Epic creation and update in a mock-first environment and links to the full spec.

## Actions

- Create new Epic with title/description/status
- Update Epic fields and links

## Notes

- This page references the deep-dive spec in the Help panel.
- The concrete UI component can be added later as the Epic list/editor is implemented.
